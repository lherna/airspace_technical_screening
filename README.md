# Airspace Technologies Technical Screening - Data Scientist

Hello John/Ksenia,

I would first like to say thank you for considering me for this position. In this repository you can find my jupyter notebook file - airspace_technical_luishndez.ipynb - that shows the way I usually handle data and perform an analysis. Using pandas dataframes as the main form of structuring the data, I first visualize the data to see if there are any relationships among the factor variables. In this case I was caught off guard and split the dataset into two for their later application of two machine learning models (linear and logistic regression). In any case, I hope that this gives you a good general view of how I tackle a problem like this. Let me know if you have any more questions or if you would like me to clarify something else, thanks.

Best, 
Luis A. Hernandez
