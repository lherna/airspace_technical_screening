# Strategic Logistics Technical Screening - Linear/Logistic Regression

This is a technical screening sent out by a strategic logistics operation company for a data scientist position. Contained in the jupyter notebook airspace_technical_luishndez.ipynb, I use pandas dataframes as the main form of structuring the data. Visualizing the data first to see if there are any relationships among the factor variables and potential response variables for a linear regression, I not only apply this model, but also a logistic regression to the binary factor column available. Serving as a general overview to see my method of cleaning data and tackling a problem, this project displays limited end results due to the size of the dataset.
